class ImageBuffer:
    '''
    Stores a limited number of images from a video (or any other source)
    Makes it easy to do N-frame-differencing, for example, by easily being
    able to get the current (middle) frame, plus the first and last frames of the
    buffer. With an ImageBuffer of size N, as images are added, eventually the
    buffer fills, and older items are dropped off the end. This is convenient
    for streaming input sources, as the user can simply keep adding images
    to this buffer, and internally, the most recent N will be kept available.
