'''
This package contains "beta" code that is not quite ready to de included in 
the main faro.pyvision distribution.  The package consists of a set of "install"
commands that add functionality to the faro.pyvision namespace.  This is to allow
easy access to new classes and methods while under development and to make
it easy to update code when that funtionality gets added to the main library.
These install functions will be deleted without notice when the code is 
include in faro.pyvision.  

For example, the video task manager can be installed like this:

import faro.pyvision as pv
pv.beta.installVideoTaskManager()
pv.VideoTaskMangager()

When the interface for the video task manager is finalized and it is added to
the main library the install command will be deleted from the beta package and
any external code that was using the beta code can just delete the insall
command.  The rest of the external code should run little or no modification.
